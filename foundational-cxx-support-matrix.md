[^next-change]: This is an estimated date. The actual date may change if the
vendor (or community, as applicable) extends or shortens the lifetime of the
dimension in question.

[^cmake]: We support the oldest version of CMake that ships with one of the
supported distros. Currently that is CMake 3.22 as Ubuntu 22.04 ships with this
version.

[^gcc]: Once openSUSE/Leap 15.5 reaches EOL we will support the oldest
version of GCC that ships with one of the supported distros.

[^clang]: We support the oldest version of Clang that ships with one of the
supported distros. Currently that is Clang 14.0 as Ubuntu 22.04 ships with
this version.

[^glibc]: We plan to support glibc >= 2.27 until further notice.
